File Entity Inline
------------------
If you add fields to a file type, such as the image file type, by default these fields are only 
accessible through the manage files interface in Backdrop CMS Core. This module exposes these
additional fields and allows a site editor to manage them throught other forms, such as node
edit forms or reference fields. 

Project Status
----------------
We ran this project through [Coder Upgrade](https://backdropcms.org/project/coder_upgrade)

Please help test this module and report bugs in the [issue queue](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/file_entity_inline/issues).
